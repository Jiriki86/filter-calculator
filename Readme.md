Simple Electric Filter Parameter Calculator
===========================================

This is a simple UI written in Qt to calculate the values for low- and high pass filters 
in electric application. Based on two given values the resistance, capacity or cut-off
frequency are calculated.

UI Layout
---------

The UI features text inputs for the required values of the resistor, capacitance and cutoff value.
The filter type can be selected using a radio button. An example image for the filter topology is 
shown below the inputs.

Requirements
__------------

* cmake
* gcc
* Qt5
